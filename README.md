# Overwatch Version 0.1.0
 It works with logs in the text file. Total 4 properties are changeable within `Settings.txt`. It has a higher CPU usage and does not store data in databases. 
 The program files should be stored in `C:\Users\{Your Username}\Overwatch`.
 
 It tracks all changes, deletions, creations, renamed files in the tracked directory (changeable in `Settings.txt`) and your screen time (including AFK time) 

## How do I use Overwatch?
Just set your properties in the `Settings.txt` file, for example:

`RunOnStartup = true`
`TrackedPath = C:\`
`DisplayInfos = false`
for the common use, it starts up when you boot the PC, minimizes directly and tracks your C:\ Drive

Save the changes and just start Overwatch, your logs will afterwards be saved in `Logs.txt` 

All changes, tracked informations about you, your datas and your screentime are saved locally onto your machine
